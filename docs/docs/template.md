## Introduction
A brief introduction to the implementation, its purpose, and its place within the overall project.

## Requirements
A list of functional and non-functional requirements, detailing the expected behavior, constraints, and limitations of the implementation.

## Interfaces
A comprehensive description of the interfaces between the current implementation and other dependent implementations.

### API Specifications
A detailed description of the API methods, including their inputs, outputs, side effects, and error conditions. Ensure that the explanations are clear and easy to understand, without requiring knowledge of the source code.

### Data Structures
A description of the data structures used in the interfaces, including their fields, types, and any constraints. Provide diagrams or visual representations if it helps to clarify the information.

### File Formats
A description of the file formats used for data exchange, including any headers, footers, or metadata. Include examples of valid file formats.

## Examples and Use Cases
Provide concrete examples and use cases for interacting with the interfaces. These should cover common scenarios, edge cases, and error handling. Make sure the examples are detailed and complete, so that developers can understand the expected behavior without consulting the source code.

## Additional Notes
Include any relevant notes, such as known issues, future improvements, or any other information that might be helpful for the developers.
