# Project Documentation Guide

This guide outlines the project's expectations for concise and salient documentation. We follow the Google Developer Documentation Style Guide, customized for our organization and Markdown syntax.

## Standards

1. **Clarity**: Write in a clear and straightforward manner. Avoid jargon, idioms, and complex language.
2. **Simplicity**: Use short sentences, simple words, and active voice. Break complex ideas into smaller, easy-to-understand parts.
3. **Consistency**: Adhere to a consistent writing style, tone, and formatting throughout all documentation.
4. **Accuracy**: Ensure that all information is accurate, complete, and up-to-date.

## Directives

### Language

- Use American English spelling and grammar.
- Prefer simple, everyday words over complex or technical terms.
- Use active voice whenever possible.

### Formatting

- Use Markdown syntax for all documentation.
- Use consistent heading styles:
  - `#` for main headings
  - `##` for subheadings
  - `###` for sub-subheadings
- Include a table of contents for documents longer than 5 sections.
- Use code blocks for code examples or commands.
- Use bold and italic text sparingly for emphasis.

### Structure

- Begin with an introduction that briefly describes the purpose of the document.
- Organize content into clear, logical sections with appropriate headings.
- Use bullet points and numbered lists for easy readability.
- End with a summary or conclusion, if applicable.
