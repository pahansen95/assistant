# Milestone 1, Feature 2, Task 2.2

## Task Goals
Implement the methods necessary to manage Session lifecycle, including session creation, session teardown, and updating the session state.

## Plan Context
This task is part of the implementation plan for the Channel Protocol, which is a custom L7 application protocol providing peer-to-peer communication via a simplified Pub/Sub architecture. The implementation plan is broken down into two milestones. This task is part of Milestone 1, which involves implementing core components, including the Peer, Session, Topic, and Message objects.

## Specification & Relevant Information
The Session object represents a network partition within a Channel that exchanges messages as network traffic. Each Session has a 10-bit ID unique to that peer, and it has a distinct lifecycle with the following states:
1. OFFLINE: There is no active communication session.
2. HANDSHAKE: Peers are coordinating the security handshake of a new communication session.
2. SETUP: Peers are coordinating the runtime initialization of a new communication session.
3. ONLINE: Peers are communicating application data across an active communication session.
4. TEARDOWN: Peers are coordinating the cleanup of the communication session.

Peers will establish Sessions to communicate application data, and it is important to manage the Session lifecycle properly. This task focuses on implementing the necessary methods to manage the Session lifecycle.

## Dependencies
This task depends on the successful completion of Task 1.1, which involves implementing a utility module for generating unique identifiers for Peers, Sessions, and Topics. It also depends on Task 2.1, which involves implementing the Peer object with a unique 128-bit identifier using the utility module.
