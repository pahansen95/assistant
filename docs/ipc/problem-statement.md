Developing distributed systems to explore emergent properties and intelligence requires a communication protocol that can scale to a large number of agents, but is also simple and easy to use. The experimental nature of the project requires a flexible and dynamic system, with a focus on exploring the emergent properties that arise from the interaction of multiple agents. The primary use case for the system involves n-body simulations, where each agent can perform a limited number of simple computational tasks, but collectively can optimize the solution.

The main challenge in development is the need for a communication protocol that is simple and easy to use, while also allowing for dynamic and flexible experimentation with emergent properties and intelligence. The protocol should not require a separate service and should avoid the need for frequent implementation of boilerplate code or reinventing the wheel, in order to speed up development time. There are no specific constraints or requirements beyond the limited amount of time available for development.
