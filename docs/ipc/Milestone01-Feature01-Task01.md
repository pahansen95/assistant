# Milestone 1, Feature 1, Task 1.1

## Task Goals
Implement a utility module for generating unique identifiers (Peers, Sessions, Topics).

## Plan Context
This task is part of the Milestone 1, which is focused on implementing the core components of the `Channel` protocol. Feature 1 of this milestone aims to implement the necessary core modules, and Task 1.1 focuses on implementing a utility module for generating unique identifiers.

## Specification & Relevant Information
The `Channel` protocol requires unique identifiers for `Peers`, `Sessions`, and `Topics`. These identifiers will be used to identify and manage the different entities involved in the protocol. Task 1.1 aims to implement a utility module that generates these unique identifiers. The unique identifier for a `Peer` should be 128 bits, for a `Session` should be 10 bits, and for a `Topic` should be 22 bits.

## Dependencies on the Outputs of Other Tasks
This task is not dependent on the outputs of any other task, as it is a standalone module. However, the unique identifiers generated by this module will be used in subsequent tasks of Milestone 1 and throughout the implementation of the protocol.
