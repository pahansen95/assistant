We are tasked with implementing simple heuristic analysis of natural language (NL). We are primarily processing NL that is generated by humans or highly sophisticated LLMs. Input length is between 1 & 3,000 words. Input content is not constrained but assumes NL.

To start we are to focus on implementing coherence of the NL content. 

Coherence Analysis is only one part of a program, we must do our best to minimize time complexity. If necessary we have access to external resources or APIs. However we should first define the functionality required of these external resources & implement abstractions that can be used to swap out underlying implementation.

Here is the relevant source code we are to work with:

```python
@dataclass
class NLPHeuristics:
  """A heuristic for assessing the quality of natural language (NL) generated by a swarm intelligence-inspired system.

  The NL content is evaluated based on the following criteria to ensure it meets the user's needs and provides a high-quality output:

  - Relevance: Utilizes keyword matching to determine if the content adequately addresses the user's prompt by identifying the presence of relevant keywords or phrases.

  - Coherence: Examines the presence of logical connectors and discourse markers, along with other cohesive devices, to assess whether the content is well-organized, clear, and effectively conveys the intended message.

  - Accuracy: Leverages external knowledge bases and reference materials to verify the correctness of the information presented in the content, ensuring reliability and credibility.

  class Keyword(NamedTuple):
    """A keyword and its relevance weight."""
    text: str
    """The keyword"""
    weight: float
    """The relevance weight. A number between 0 and 1 (inclusive) where 1 indicates the highest relevance."""

    # ...

    """Calculates the coherence score of a natural language content.

        ...

    Returns:
        float: The coherence score of the content, in the range [0, 1]. A score

    """
    """Development Notes:

    # Analytical techniques for near real-time coherence analysis (< 60 seconds)

    1. Cohesive devices: Assessing the use of cohesive devices such as conjunctions, transitional phrases, and discourse markers is a relatively simple and efficient way to evaluate coherence. This can be implemented using rule-based or pattern-matching techniques to identify and count the occurrences of these devices in the text. This approach assumes that a higher count of cohesive devices correlates with better coherence.

    2. Pronoun consistency: Checking for pronoun consistency is another relatively simple method. You can create a rule-based system that tracks pronoun usage and ensures that they match in terms of number, gender, and person. This assumes that consistent pronoun usage contributes to overall coherence.

    3. Topic shift: Evaluating smooth topic shifts could be more computationally intensive, but it can be simplified by measuring the frequency of specific transition words or phrases that indicate a topic shift. This approach assumes that an adequate number of topic shift indicators correlate with better coherence.

    The relevance score is calculated based on the weighted count of relevant
    keywords in the content, where the weights are defined by the user. This
    method considers both the frequency and relevance of the keywords in the
    content, applying a weighting factor to the frequency score. The weighted
    count of each keyword is capped to prevent any one keyword from dominating
    the final score.

        content (str): The natural language content to be evaluated.

            weights that will be used to assess the relevance of the content.

            keyword can be counted in the final score. Defaults to 5.
        weighting_factor (float, optional): A factor to apply to the frequency
            score of the keywords in the content, in the range (0, 1]. A factor
            of 1.0 means that frequency is equally important as relevance in
            the final score, while a factor of 0.0 means that only relevance
            matters. Defaults to 0.5.

        float: The relevance score of the content, in the range [0, 1]. A score
        of 1 indicates the highest relevance.

    Raises:
        AssertionError: If the content is not a string, the keywords is not a
            list, the keywords weights are not numbers between 0 and 1, or the
            max_weighted_count is not a positive integer.
